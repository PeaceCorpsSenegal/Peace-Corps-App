This is an under-development web application for Peace Corps posts, written in PHP with a MySQL database. It serves external content in the form of pages (like a traditional site) but also utilizes a Facebook-based user authentication system to allow the sharing of contact information and private resources. It's currently highly unstable and has no installer. If interested in working with it, please contact its developer.
